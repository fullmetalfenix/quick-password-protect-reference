# quick-password-protect-reference
I've been asked a few times in different situations to quickly lock something from public view on a web server. I'm adding this for a reference so I don't have to keep reminding myself how.

1. Copy these files into the directory to lock

2. Change the info in the pw file with the pw hashed with an algorithm appropriate for your server
