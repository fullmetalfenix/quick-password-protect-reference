# Encrypt the pw first - which encryption algorithm. you use is dependent on the age of your server (MD5 or SHA1) 
# - Example: if you want your pw to be "hashed-pw" and username to be "Admin" you would do "Admin:$apr1$j0cam2l5$tdg.0BDyxypIA/ZgTwXBe0"
# but when prompted you would still type Username: Admin, Password: hashed-pw.
#
#  
Admin: whatever-the-hashed-version-of-your-pw-is
